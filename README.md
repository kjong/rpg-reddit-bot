# rpg-reddit-bot

A Reddit bot written in Python and PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Searches comments for the keyword (!rpgme) and generates an RPG character based on the comment author's username using a modified version of my RPG character generator (https://github.com/kjong/rpg-character-generator).

The bot is running on an Ubuntu droplet provided by DigitalOcean.
